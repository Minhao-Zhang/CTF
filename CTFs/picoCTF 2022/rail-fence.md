Download the message [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/273/message.txt).

Put the decoded message in the picoCTF flag format, picoCTF{decoded_message}.

## Solution 

We can use an online decoder like [this](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/rail-fence-cipher).

The decoded message is `The flag is: WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_83F6D8D7`.

## Flag 

`picoCTF{WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_83F6D8D7}`
