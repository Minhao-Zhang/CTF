# picoCTF 2022 - Redaction gone wrong (Forensics)

## Description

Now you DONâ€™T see me.

This [report](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/264/Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf) has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not.
Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?

## Solution

Open up this pdf, we can see some black blocks covering the text.

We can copy the text and paste it into somewhere that can only show plain text like the search bar of the browser.
